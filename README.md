I have developed Tic-Tac-Toe Game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Two Player game first is PlayerX and Second is PlayerO,

when playerx click on a box in the board the box will mark as X, when playero click on a box in the board the box will mark as O,

First turn is PlayerX everytime when game will reset,

both player can click any box in the board at their trun,

which player match 3 boxes of his mark vertically or horizontally or diagnollay will Win the game.

if both player can't match 3 boxes of their mark then game will Tie.
